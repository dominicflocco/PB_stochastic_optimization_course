Chapter 1\n","\n","### Problem Statement\n","Consider a farmer who specializes in raising wheat, corn and sugar beets on his 500 acres of land. During the winter, he wants to decide how much land to devote to each crop. The farmer knows that at least 200 tons of wheat and 240 tons of corn are needed to feed his cattle. These amounts can be raised on the farm or bought from a wholesaler. Any production in excess of the feeding requirement would be sold. The purchase prices are 40% higher than the selling prices due to the wholesaler's margin and transportation. The other profitable crop the farmer has at his disposal is sugar beets, which he expects to sell at \\\\$36/ton. However, there is a quota on sugar beet production, which means any amount in excess of the quota can sold only at \\\\$10/ton. The farmer's quota for next year is 6000 tons.\n","\n","Based on past experience, the farmer knows that the mean yield on his land is roughly 2.5 tons, 3 tons, and 20 tons per acre for wheat, corn and sugar beets, respectively. The following table summarizes the data inputs for the problem\n","\n","|    | Wheat | Corn | Sugar Beets |\n","| -- | ----- | ---- | ----------- |\n","| Yield (ton/acre) | 2.5 | 3 | 20 |\n","| Planting cost (\\\\$/acre) | 150 | 230 | 260 |\n","| Selling price (\\\\$/ton) | 170 | 150| 36 under 6000 tons|\n","| | | | 10 above 6000 tons|\n","|Purchase price (\\\\$/ton) |238 | 210 |  |\n","| Minimum requirement (tons)| 200 | 240 | |\n","\n","The farmer's goal is to maximize net profits while satisfying the feeding requirements for his cattle.\n","\n","### Problem Formulation (Deterministic)\n","To formulate this problem as a linear program (LP), we'll use the following notation:\n","\n","- $x_1$: acres of land devoted to wheat,\n","- $x_2$: acres of land devoted to corn,\n","- $x_3$ acres of land devoted to sugar beets,\n","- $w_1$ tons of wheat sold,\n","- $y_1$: tons of wheat purchased,\n","- $w_2$: tons of corn sold,\n","- $y_2$: tons of corn purchased,\n","- $w_3$: tons of sugar beets sold at the favorable price (under quota)\n","- $w_4$: tons of sugar beets sold at the lower price (over quota)\n","\n","Using the data above, the LP formulation in the deterministic setting is:\n","\n","\n","\\begin{align}\n","  \\min \\quad & 150x_1 + 230x_2 + 260x_3 & \\text{Planting costs}\\\\\n","              & +238y_1 + 210y_2 & \\text{Purchase costs}\\\\\n","              & - (170w_1 + 150w_2 - 26w_3 - 10w_4) & \\text{Revenues}\\\\\n","  \\text{s.t.}\\quad & x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \\leq 500 & \\text{Total land available} \\\\\n","  & 2.5x_1 + y_1 - w_1 \\geq 200 & \\text{Wheat min. requirement}\\\\\n","  & 3x_2 + y_2 - w_2 \\geq 240 & \\text{Corn min. requirement}\\\\\n","  & w_3 + w_4 - 20x_3 \\leq 0 & \\text{Sugar beets}\\\\\n","  & w_3 \\leq 600 & \\text{1st part of quota}\\\\\n","  &x_1, x_2, x_3,w_1,y_1,w_2,y_2, w_3,w_4 \\geq 0 & \\text{Nonnegativity}\n","  \\end{align}\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EyfGlTtljETK"},"source":["## Deterministic Model Implementation\n","We will implement the Farmer's problem LP using [`Pyomo`](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
