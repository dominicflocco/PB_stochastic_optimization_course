J., Carri√≥n, M., & Morales, J. M. (2010). *Decision making under uncertainty in electricity markets* (Vol. 1, pp. 376-384). New York: Springer. Chapter 2.\n","\n","### Problem Statement\n","Consider an electricity producer with a production capacity of 120 MW who is facing both uncertain electricty demand and price for the next week. This producer needs to determin its selling strategy during a future market horizon of 6 days, divideded into two 3-day periods. The producer has the folloing bilateral contracts available:\n","1) A selling contract of up to 50 MW at \\\\$25/MHw at the beginning of the 6-day period and spanning the entire 6-day period.\n","2) A selling contract of up to 40 MW at \\\\$26/HWh just after the first 3-day period and covering the last 3-day period.\n","More concretely, the contract data for the producer is given in the table below.\n","\n","| Contract | Duration | Hours | Price (\\$/MWh) | Power Cap. (MW)|\n","| -------- | -------- | ----- | ------------- | ---------------|\n","| A | Entire 6-day period | 144 | 25 | 50 |\n","| B | 2nd 3-day period | 72| 26| 40|\n","\n","Complementarily to bilateral contracting, the producer can sell energy in the poolat a constant power during the first and second 3-day periods. The pool prices scenarios are:\n","\n","1. Pool prices for the first 3-day period are \\\\$27/MHw with probability 0.4 and \\\\$23/MWh with probability 0.6\n","2. If the pice during the first 3-day period is \\\\$27/MWh, prices during the second 3-day period are \\\\$28/MWh with probability 0.4 and \\\\$26/MWh with probability 0.6.\n","3. Alternatively, if the price during the first 3-day period is \\\\$23/MWh, prices during the second 2-day period are \\\\$24/MWh with probability 0.4 and \\\\$22/MWh with probability 0.6\n","\n","The scenaro data for the producer is given in the following table:\n","\n","| Scenario | 1st 2-day price (\\\\$/MWh) | 2nd 3-day price (\\\\$/MWh) | Probability (per unit)|\n","| - | - | - | - |\n","| 1 | 27 | 28 | $0.4\\times 0.4= 0.16$|\n","| 2 | 27 | 26 | $0.4\\times 0.6  =0.24$|\n","| 3 | 23 | 24 | $0.6\\times 0.4 =0.24$|\n","| 4 | 23 | 22 | $0.6\\times 0.6 =0.36$|\n","\n","The decision-making problem faced by the producer can be formulated as a three-stage stochastic programming problem. The decision process is as follows:\n","1. Before the 6-day period the producer needs to decide the quantity to be sold through the contract spanning the whole 6-day period. This is the first-stage decision.\n","2. For each price realization of the first 3-day period, the producer has to decide both the amount of energy to be sold through the contract spanning the second 3-day period and the amount of energy to be sold in the pool during the first 3-day period. These are the second-stage decisions, which depend on the pool price realization in the first 3-day period.\n","3. Finally, the producer needs to decide the power to be sold in the pool, which spans the second 3-day period, for each one of the four price com- binations involving first and second 3-day periods.\n","\n","### Problem Formulation (Scenario-Variable)\n","To formulate this problem as a multi-stage stocahstic optimization problem, we'll use the following notation:\n","- $P_{\\omega}^c$ for $\\omega = 1,2,3,4$ and $c \\in \\{A,B\\}$: power to be sold through contract $c$ in scenario $\\omega$\n","- $P_\\omega^t$ for $\\omega = 1,2,3,4$ and $t \\in \\{t_1, t_2\\}$: power to be sold in the pool for period $t$ in scenario $\\omega$\n","\n","Using the data above, the LP formulation for this three-stage stochastic model is:\n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{align*}\n","\\max \\quad & \\Pi^S = 0.16 \\times 72(2\\times 25P_1^A + 26P_1^B + 27P_1^{t_1} + 28P_1^{t_2}) & \\text{Revenue $\\omega = 1$}\\\\\n","& \\quad +  0.24\\times 72(2\\times 25P_2^A + 26P_2^B + 27P_2^{t_1} + 26P_2^{t_2}) & \\text{Revenue $\\omega = 2$}\\\\\n","& \\quad +  0.24 \\times 72(2\\times 25P_3^A + 26P_3^B + 23P_3^{t_1} + 24P_3^{t_2}) & \\text{Revenue $\\omega = 3$}\\\\\n","& \\quad +  0.36 \\times 72(2\\times 25P_4^A + 26P_4^B + 23P_4^{t_1} + 22P_4^{t_2}) & \\text{Revenue $\\omega = 4$}\\\\\n","\\text{s.t.} \\quad & P_1^A + P_1^{t_1} \\leq 120 & \\text{Prod cap period $t_1$, scenario $\\omega=1$} \\\\\n","& P_2^A + P_2^{t_1} \\leq 120 & \\text{Prod cap period $t_1$, scenario $\\omega=2$} \\\\\n","& P_3^A + P_3^{t_1} \\leq 120 & \\text{Prod cap period $t_1$, scenario $\\omega=3$} \\\\\n","& P_4^A + P_4^{t_1} \\leq 120 & \\text{Prod cap period $t_1$, scenario $\\omega=4$} \\\\\n","& P_1^A + P_1^B + P_1^{t_2} \\leq 120 & \\text{Prod cap period $t_2$, scenario $\\omega=1$} \\\\\n","& P_2^A + P_2^B + P_2^{t_2} \\leq 120 & \\text{Prod cap period $t_2$, scenario $\\omega=2$} \\\\\n","& P_3^A + P_3^B + P_3^{t_2} \\leq 120 & \\text{Prod cap period $t_2$, scenario $\\omega=3$} \\\\\n","& P_4^A + P_4^B + P_4^{t_2} \\leq 120 & \\text{Prod cap period $t_2$, scenario $\\omega=4$} \\\\\n","& 0 \\leq P_\\omega^A \\leq 50 \\qquad \\omega = 1,2,3,4 & \\text{Contract A cap} \\\\\n","& 0 \\leq P_\\omega^B\\leq 40 \\qquad \\omega = 1,2,3,4 & \\text{Contract B cap} \\\\\n","& P_1^A = P_2^A = P_3^A = P_4^A & \\text{Stage 1 nonanticipitivity} \\\\\n","& P_1^B = P_2^B,  P_3^B = P_4^B & \\text{Stage 2 nonanticipitivity} \\\\\n","& P_1^{t_1} = P_2^{t_1},  P_3^{t_1} = P_4^{t_1} & \\text{Stage 2 nonanticipitivity} \\\\\n","\\end{align*}\n","$$"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PwnqbXFB0ONz"},"source":["## Stochastic Model Implementation\n","We will implement this power market contract model using [`Pyomo`](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
