Chapter 4.\n","\n","### Problem Statement\n","Consider the problem faced by an elextricity retailer that seeks to determin the purchases in the futures market in order to maximize the profit resulting from selling energy to a group of clients. In doing so, the retailer buys energy in both the pool and a futres market. The price of the energy in the pool in each period $t$ is assumed to be unkonwn and is characterized as a random variable. The retailer participates in the futures market by buying energy through three different contracts, defined by a purchasing price, and a maximum quantity of power that can be purchased. The demand of the consumers in each period is assumed to be known, while the selling price of energy to the clients is fixed to $35/MWh. For this example, we consider a planning ohrizon comprised of 3 hourly periods.\n","\n","The client demands for the three periods are 150, 225, and 175 MW.
